    <h1>It's been already a month?</h1>
    <p id="side">tap fast 3 times on "<span class="highlight">LOVE</span>"</p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">I</span> cannot believe it passed this fast, but
      the only thing I believe is that my love for you is also increasing fast,
      and deeper and I've never felt like this before, not being able to explain
      what I feel, but being able to get a smile on my face immediately when I
      even just think about you. You are my source of happiness, you're my
      source of opening my heart again and making it feel alive, making it feel
      something it never felt before, which is the love I have for you, you are
      my everything. If I ever knew that I'm gonna meet someone like you, I
      wouldn't believe myself. Someone who knows how to love, someone who knows
      how to care, someone who fills my empty heart and loving it again. I wish
      for many things in my life, but talking about them is our future, our
      future which is patently waiting for us and us, who must go through many
      ups and downs, through many obstacles that await us, which we must
      overcome together, I'm sure we will because I have big hopes for us and
      beliefs. My <span class="highlight">LOVE</span>, my beautiful, smart and
      caring love, I love you so much, so much that you're not even aware of it.
      So much that I'll do everything it takes just to stay with you, I'll give
      everything just to keep you in my life, I'll sacrifice everything just to
      not lose you and the love you're giving to me. Our pasts were bad, but
      together we can have a much more beautiful and better life, which will
      include a lot of happiness and everything we want to have together, I
      really hope for that, and I'm waiting for the day we will finally be
      together and never be separated again. There's a lot of more things that I
      could tell you, but words can't describe any of it, any of those feelings
      inside of me, but all I can say is thank you, thank you for existing in my
      life, making it feel alive again, making it happy and feel the feelings I
      couldn't before, thank you for loving me the way you do, and HAPPY OUR
      FIRST MONTH TOGETHER, hopefully there would be many more from now on, I
      LOVE
      <span class="highlight">YOU! â™¡</span>
